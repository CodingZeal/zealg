# Zealg

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/zealg`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

    $ gem install zealg

## Usage

In a fresh rails project run:

    $ zealg boilerplate

This will do the following:
- Clone the [zeal react-boilerplate](https://www.github.com/CodingZeal/react-boilerplate) into the `./tmp/` directory
- Copy any files and folders from the boilerplate into the rails root directory
- Add some methods to your `app/assets/application_helper.rb` file for asset linking
- Add a layout template `app/views/layouts/client.rb`

That's it!!!

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
